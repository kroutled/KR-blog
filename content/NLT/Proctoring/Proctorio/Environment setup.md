- First we will need to register a new environment at Proctorio. So we email our Proctorio representative requesting the new environment. 
- We usually send a mail to: Dejana Jovanovic <dejana@proctorio.com>
```
Good day Dejana,  

I hope this email finds you well. 

We are now ready to add our new client, {CLIENTNAME}, to Proctorio.  

Please may you provide us with the request form.  

Thank you  
Kind regards
```

  - Once completed on their side they will send a once off link to access the environment's API keys which we then store in the clients Proctor database on our side in the `Proctorio.ProctorioConfig` table.
