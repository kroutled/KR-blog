# What is proctoring? 
Proctorio is a cutting-edge proctoring tool specifically crafted to address the challenges of conducting secure online exams and assessments within a Learning Management System. With a focus on maintaining academic integrity, this solution provides a comprehensive set of features that empower educational institutions and instructors to confidently deliver and assess exams in virtual environments.
# Learner Process

1. There are three activities that make up an Assessment block as seen below.
	- The first activity `Exam Declaration | 1st Seating Demo` is an optional Activity that can be used to notify the learner of various rules, how-tos and additional information surrounding the exam they are about to take. 
	- The second activity `V1 | Summative Assesssment | Demo | Proctoring` is what is known as the 'Authentication' activity and is mandatory. 
	- The third activity `V1 | Summative Assessment | Demo` which is the proctored exam itself and is automatically directed to once the learner has completed their 'Authentication' from the previous activity.

## Authentication Process

1. Once the learner selects the 'Authentication' activity - `V1 | Summative Assesssment | Demo | Proctoring` in this case they will be directed to the below steps. 

>[!Note]
>This is only once the learner has installed the Proctorio Plugin in the Browser.
>It is reccomended to use either a Chrome or Edge Browser for best results.

2. Firstly they will be given a brief overview of what to expect and what requirements are entailed for the proctored exam assessment. If there are any open tabs they will receive an error message such as below to close the tabs before continuing.

3. Next before beginning the 'System Diagnostic Test' the learner will be asked to share their screen, they can simply select the screen they wish to write from and click 'Share'
   The next step in the process is a 'System Diagnostics Test' which will make sure you have the required hardware and internet connection to complete the exam assessment. This includes:
	- Having a working webcam.
	- Having a working microphone.
	- Having a stable and fast enough internet connection.
	- Being able to share the screen of the device the learner will be taking the exam assessment on.

 By selecting 'Load', a list of learners for that Exam/Activity will be loaded, this is where the Moderator can select the appropriate outcome of the learner.

If the Moderator would like to go into that learner's proctored exam record in more detail they can select the 'View Logs' which will open a more in depth view of all records(known as a Grade Book) for that Exam/Activity and will allow Moderators to view the video and audio of the proctored exam, if there were any suspicious flags triggered and a host of other options and settings.
