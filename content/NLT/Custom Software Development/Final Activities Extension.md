# Purpose
To account for multiple attempts on an assessment activity in aNS
For example if the learner passes Attempt one there is no need to unlock the attempt 2 actvity and we can set the Course score to reflect the attempt 1 score. 
However if they fail attempt 1 we need to unlock attempt 2 and then use that activity as the Course Score. 

### Further understandings. 

On aNewSpring there are Courses. Within the Courses we can create blocks/activities of different types. Usually a Final Activity of type `Assessment` or similar is used to to base the overall Score/Grade of the Subscription to that Course and to mark the Subscription as complete. 

At the moment on aNewSpring only one Final Activity can be set to represent the overall Score/Grade for that Subscription. I.E. When a learner is subscribed to a course, they work through the course content and then are assessed on their knowledge of the content by completing the Final Activity and given a Score/Grade. If this Score/Grade meets the set criteria they are then marked as having passed/failed the Course(Subscription). There can also be more than one attempt at the Final Activity if failed on the first try. Should they not pass the assessment in the given number of attempts the Course(Subscription) is then locked? 

Wellness warehouse has requested this extension as a way to add more than one Final Activity to a course, a learner must then pass all Final Activities to pass the Course(Subscription) in it's entirety.
