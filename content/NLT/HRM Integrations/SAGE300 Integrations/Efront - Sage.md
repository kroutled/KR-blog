The clients currently using this integration include:
- Tharisa

# Process

The process is essentially the same as the integration between aNewSpring and SAGE300 as is documented here: [[aNS-SAGE300 Integration Installation and Admin User Guide.pdf]].
More information regarding how the Integrator works can be found here: [[Sage300 Integration database and views explained]]

However there will be some small differences within the integrator relating to Efront directly.

The source code can be located here: https://dev.azure.com/NewLeafDevelopment/Sage_300_People_THARISA and can be used a template for future integrations with Efront. 

>[!Note]
>The above documentation and process is subject to change in the future as the SAGE API is now available and will achieve the integration more effectively.
