- Replacing Google Classroom LMS with aNS 
- Integration required
	- HR DB
	- Content migration from Google to aNS(to be done by Ampath)
	- Workday change over
		- Will be replaced by SAGE300 HRMs
			- Will be integrated into aNS env
	- Scanned docs, results, historic data(most likely csv files), 
	- Quiz migration
		- IT competencies tests(Google forms)
			- Abby to action.
- Kyle/NLT to ask for full list of features and requirements of classroom based plugins in scoping meetings next week. 
	- Need to fully understand the existing process -> end to end process for different types of learners. + Workflow process. 
	- Understand what expectations there are for the new system that are not being met by their current system. 
		- How are resources stored
		- How do learners access assesments
			- Are they generally employees(will they be loaded into SAGE once up and running)
			- Are they walk ins or once offs? 
		- Understand Certificates and how they are currently generated and issued.
		- Understanding of the Portfolios and how they are structured and used and stored. 
		- Sample of each asset/export/resource/screenshots that would be reflected on NLT aNS plugin system.

## Minutes and notes
-  Labs are a priority to get onto aNS. 
- Give register names and surnames to Abby to create accounts. 
- Need to change Logo on aNS login screen*
- Lisa to send Articulate OTS catalogue to Gideon and team
- Can reporting be done on certificates and certificate expiration dates
- Investigate reseller courses + external courses and Learner Agreements, breaches etc. 
- SAGE autosubscribtion based on certain conditions
- Reporting via aNS or TIS
- Custom fields that can be used for ID numbers
- HPCSA validation and how it can be tracked(Custom field, TIS)
- March 2025 - is when moving over to SAGE300 
	- Work day available until June Next year. 
- Labs and technical training to go onto aNS in phase 1
	- 1500 liscenses to be used initially as proof of concept
	- aNS will be used in tandem with WorkDay until moved over to SAGE
- Mailing functionality needs to be restricted in various ways to avoid learners by passing business communication platforms. 
	- Discussion boards to be reviewed to discourage the above. 
	- Can be disabled per course.  
	- Facilitators/instructors may have a need to give feedback to learners. 
- 50 instructors to be added, will be sent through by Gideon and team.
- TIS -> filtering based on WorkDay role/org heirarchy.
- Classroom based courses/learnings that are happening on day to day need to be captured via the system
	- Classroom plugin. 
		- might be over 5 mins, 1 hour, 5 days, 3 months etc. etc. 
		- Seems to be a a plugin where someone can then capture what was trained on, who was trained, duration of training, etc. 
		- **Need to investigate other scenarios and file storage things? Portfolio things**
- Moodle - phase 2 migrations(potential) of all courses
	- Also looking at moving historical data to TIS
- 512MB file size limit on uploading, but unlimited space for uploads.
	- Vimeo and Youtube can be embedded in aNS to bypass this limitation.
- **Subscription questions: Once subscribed a license is allocated and then can subscribe to unlimited courses or is it per subscribcription? **
- Courses to go live with
	- Molecular course(Powerpoint presentations and then google forms as assessments)
	- Immunology course?
	- Theoretical(videos that need to be segmented)
- How would scheduling work now on aNS? 
- Certificates to be standardised.
- Tests are set for specific dates and over specific times.
- Blended learning approach - combining in class programs with aNS and how it's managed.??
	- Good Laboratory Practice material to be sent and used for training and example.
		- 1 day classroom 4 days lab
			- Write test at start of class day on previous weeks work and then lectures start again.
		- Write board exams
- Check out Lab Vine(LMS competitors)
- How will document storage work
	- For example scanned documents of class room tests etc. 
- Success Metrics
	- Successfully register
	- Successfully complete course
	- Successfully results recorded and reported on 
- Go live strat: 
	- Jana will co-ordinate this 
- Portfolio of Evidence(P.o.E)
	- Can be handled by aNS where learner does hand in activity.
- CPD points
	- Co-ordinator of event populates spreadsheet with people who have attended the class/training. 
	- Internally co-ordinated based on sub numbers
	- Priscilla to show us current process

## Classroom plugin
- This is similar to a log book. 
- Captures a list of learners assigned to a training or observation or short forum learning etc.
- Can be anywhere from 5 mins to months long.
- Initial system developed by DevIT.
	- Might get access to this or be able to host and embed on our side. 
- Generates registrars and registration/attendance forms to be signed by learners as proof for MICETA etc .

SAGE
- Bursary/potential university students that are not on Payroll as of yet need to be reported on, but wont be created on aNS - needs to be scoped as SAGE/Classroom Plugin and perhaps pulled into TIS?

- VAKT - styles of learning
